Missing steps:

### Configure DNS for reddit.local
To access your reddit open source app, you must be able to resolve https://reddit.local to your virtual machine. First, find the ip address of your virtual machine, then update your 'hosts' file (on your desktop or wherever your web browser is running).

## Next steps

* access reddit open source at https://reddit.local
* login and change the passwords of accounts 'reddit' and 'automoderator', they have default password 'password'
